Given a method that returns the sum of two integers.

Collect the two integers, read the value of the two integers. 
Perform an addition calculation on the integers. 

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
START

# a method that returns the sum of two integers

SET integers = 2

SET integer 1
SET integer 2

READ result = integer 1 plus integer 2

PRINT result

END

Given an array of strings. 

Iterate through the array one by one
 - save the first string to a different string value
 - for each iteration , add a space after the word
 - continue to process through the entire array
 - if the array is empty complete the iteration

After iterating, return the value of the saved string

START

# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together 

SET array_of_strings
SET empty_string_value

WHILE array_of_strings is not empty
  empty_string_value << current_index of array_of_strings
  empty_string value = empty_string_value + " "(space)
  
  current_index = current_index + 1

PRINT empty_string_value

Given an array of integers.

Create a new array

Iterate through the array one by one
  -Evaluate the first number, send it to new array
  -After one number is evaluated skip the next number
  -Evaluate the next number, send it to new array
Repeat until end of array

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

START 

# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element 

SET array_of_integers
SET empty_array

WHILE array_of_integers 
  SET empty_array << value at index in array_of_integers
    index = index + 2

PRINT empty_array

END
